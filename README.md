## Introduction

The Zeugwerk GmbH is a specialist in the field of modern software engineering in automation.
We support companies in developing standardized automation software based on modern concepts. The aim is to be able to deliver sustainably stable, error-free software at short intervals.

With the products Zeugwerk Framework and Zeugwerk Creator, Zeugwerk offers a fully integrated application framework for the structured development of PLC software.
The Zeugwerk framework is completely object-oriented. Libraries and applications have a consistent, modern architecture.
In addition to the fully integrated Zeugwerk application, the framework objects can also be easily used in existing PLC projects and thus create
an immediate added value.
The Zeugwerk Creator is an extension of the development environment (TwinCAT XAE Shell). The additional functions in the IDE make the development of a framework-based Zeugwerk application child's play.

## Quickstart
