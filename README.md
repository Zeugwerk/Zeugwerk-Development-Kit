# Zeugwerk Development Kit

## Introduction

We at Zeugwerk GmbH are a team of experts in the field of modern software engineering in automation.
We support companies in developing automation software based on modern concepts and standardization. The aim is to be able to deliver sustainably stable, error-free software in short intervals.

With the products **Zeugwerk Framework** and **Zeugwerk Creator**, Zeugwerk offers a fully integrated application framework for the structured development of PLC software.
Zeugwerk Framework is a set of libraries together with an application template. The libraries are programmed fully object-oriented, which facilities modularization and reusability. Libraries and applications have a consistent, 
modern architecture and have well-defined external interfaces. Furthermore the framework is automatically unit- and integration tested via Continuous Integration.
In addition to the fully integrated Zeugwerk application, all framework objects can be easily used in existing PLC projects, adding immediate value to legacy applications. The latter also facilitates the transition from classical PLC programming to framework-driven, object-oriented programming substantially.
Zeugwerk Creator is an extension of the development environment (TwinCAT XAE Shell). The additional functions it extends the IDE with, make developing of a framework-based application a piece of cake.
